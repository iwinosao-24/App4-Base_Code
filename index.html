Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to be able to determine if the symptoms someone has aligns with that of Endometriosis or a UTI. 
 
Known Issues:
Issues with this code are that the the results are out of 200 not 100. Additionally, the comments I made are also showing up on the webiste.
